# Fit 1D & 2D synthetic signals

Please follow the ```motivation_fit.py``` and ```motivation2D_fit.py``` to generate 1D and 2D synthetic signals and fit them with Siren. These two scripts will generate npy files that store the convergence epochs. Then please use the ```motivation_plot.py``` and ```motivation2D_plot.py``` to generate the motivation figure to illustrate the exponential-increase hypothesis:
